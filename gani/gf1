The TOC magic is in the styles that are used to format headings. The heading for this section, Use styles for headings, might look like a heading, but it doesn’t act like one. It’s formatted in pieces (font size, underline) instead of being formatted with a style. See how it’s not in the TOC you added? To add a heading to a TOC, it needs to be formatted with the Heading 1 style.
Try It: Update the style, and then update the TOC.
1.	Click in the heading above (Use styles for headings)—be sure to just click, don’t select anything.
2.	On the Home tab, find Styles, and click Heading 1 (keyboard shortcut: Alt+Ctrl+1).
3.	Update your TOC like you did before, but this time, select Update entire table (instead of Update page numbers only) since more than the page numbers changed. 
Now Word knows that paragraph is a heading, and includes it in the TOC.
